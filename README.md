== What the heck is this? ==

I'm Bored so I'm taking a look at
[49 game clone ideas](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/) and taking my changes at it in a web
friendly perspective. Mainly I've started from the Phaser tutorial an will move
on from there.


= So what have we got so far? =
Nothing

== Quick run ==
Serve it locally:
```
npm ci
npm run start
```

== 01 Dodge game ==

Quick and dirty raw implementation of a simple game of dodging some falling sky
pieces, grabbing others. Incremental difficulty, together with a small randomness.

== 02 card memory game  ==
A Pokemon  card memory game
