I'm Bored so I'm taking a look at
[49 game clone ideas](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/) and taking my changes at it in a web
friendly perspective. Mainly I've started from the Phaser tutorial an will move
on from there.

pieces, grabing others. Incremental difficulty, togheter with a small randomness.
